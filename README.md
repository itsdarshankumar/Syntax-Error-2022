# Syntax-Error-2022

## About
This is the repository for our submission for the SDSLabs Syntax Error 2022. We wished to create a mock trading web app using the SERN Stack (SQL, Express.js, React.js and Node.js) based on real-time data using Finnhub API. 
Our project has a complete backend and yet in its incubation mode. Many changes and improvements may be made at a later stage.
